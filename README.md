The librarian for making Pokémon proxies. proxdex keeps every card's assets in
a predictable place keyed by its **set + collector number** (`ex3-90`), tracks
which pipeline stage each card has reached, corrects thin card frames, and
records what you've actually printed — so a growing collection stays easy to
search, and you never reprint a card you already have.

It's the glue around the tools that do the heavy lifting:
[**cardbleed**](https://github.com/ErikBavenstrand/cardbleed) (border
extension) and **paperloom** (print-sheet layout), plus
[Upscayl](https://upscayl.org) for upscaling.

## Pipeline

Each card moves through four stages, one file per stage in its own folder:

| # | stage      | produced by                    | proxdex command  |
|---|------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | `original` | downloaded from scrydex        | `proxdex fetch` / `search` |
| 2 | `upscaled` | Upscayl (its CLI, or the GUI)  | `proxdex upscale` / `import` |
| 3 | `edited`   | uniform saturation/contrast    | `proxdex grade`  |
| 4 | `print`    | frame-corrected + cardbleed    | `proxdex border` |

> **Where do effects go?** Grade at **stage 3 — after upscaling, before
> cardbleed.** Upscayl's models shift contrast and saturation themselves, so
> grading the upscaled pixels is what-you-see-is-what-prints; and grading
> before the border step means the extended border inherits the corrected
> colour. See [uniform prints](#uniform-prints).

## Install

```bash
uv tool install proxdex        # or: pip install proxdex
```

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Pokémon\ Proxies
proxdex init                   # one-time: create the library here

proxdex search entei ex        # find a card by name, pick which print to fetch
proxdex fetch ex3-90 ex6-105   # or download directly by id
proxdex upscale                # stage 2 via Upscayl's bundled CLI
# ...or upscale in the Upscayl GUI and import the results:
proxdex import ~/upscaled/*.png             # files ex*_upscayl_*.png as stage 2
proxdex import scan.png --id ex6-105        # arbitrary file → looks up + files it

proxdex grade                  # stage 3 for every card (uniform recipe)
proxdex measure                # how thin is each frame? what needs extending?
proxdex border --write-print   # stage 4 via cardbleed, per-edge

proxdex ls                     # every card, stage progress, printed?
proxdex index                  # regenerate INDEX.md
```

Commands accept card ids to scope them (`proxdex grade ex6-105`); with none,
they act on the whole library. `proxdex` searches up from the current
directory for `proxdex.toml`, or pass `--root DIR`.

### Finding cards

Don't know the id? `proxdex search` queries the TCG API by name — every word
must appear in the card name — and shows each match's set, release year,
collector number, rarity and artist so you can tell prints apart:

```
$ proxdex search entei ex
#  ID       Name            Set                       Year     No.  Rarity        Artist
1  ex4-91   Entei ex        Team Magma vs Team Aqua   2004   91/95  Rare Holo EX  Ryo Ueda
2  ex7-97   Rocket's Entei  Team Rocket Returns       2004  97/109  Rare Holo EX  Ryo Ueda
3  bw5-13   Entei-EX        Dark Explorers            2012  13/108  Rare Holo EX  Shizurow
Fetch which? [numbers/ranges/ids · 'all' · blank to cancel]: 1
```

Type `1`, `1,3`, `1-3`, an id, or `all`. Narrow with `--set base1`,
`--rarity holo`, `--year 2004`; skip the prompt with `--select 1,3` or
`--fetch`; add `--open` to preview result images in your browser.

### Upscaling

`proxdex upscale` drives Upscayl's engine (`upscayl-bin`) directly — no GUI
round-trip — and mirrors the app's own options: any of the seven built-in
models, an output scale, and optional **Double Upscayl** (runs the model twice,
so 2× doubled = 4×, up to 16×). The command construction matches the app
exactly, including only passing `-s` when the scale differs from the model's
native 4×. On macOS the bundled binary and models are auto-detected inside
`Upscayl.app`; elsewhere set the paths under `[tools]`.

Set defaults once in `proxdex.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
upscayl_model  = "digital-art-4x"  # + upscayl-standard-4x, upscayl-lite-4x, high-fidelity-4x,
                                   #   remacri-4x, ultramix-balanced-4x, ultrasharp-4x
upscayl_scale  = 2                 # 1, 2, 3, or 4
upscayl_double = true              # run the model twice (default on → 2× becomes 4×)
```

Override per run: `proxdex upscale --model ultrasharp-4x --scale 4 --double`.
Prefer the GUI? Skip this step and `proxdex import` its output instead.

## Border correction

Real cards have a uniform frame on the top and both sides and a **thicker
bottom** (set symbol, ©). Some scrydex scans are cut into the frame, so a
printed-and-cut proxy ends up with a border that's too thin. `proxdex measure`
reports the top and side thickness (the bottom is deliberately never measured);
`proxdex border` computes the per-edge extension — *frame correction + cut
bleed* — and hands it to cardbleed, which continues the existing border pattern
rather than smearing pixels.

By default the target is symmetric (pad thin edges up to the sides). Once
you've eyeballed a known-good card, set a real-card ratio in `proxdex.toml`:

```toml
[border]
target_side_ratio = 0.045   # side frame ≈ 4.5% of card width
```

## Uniform prints

A mixed collection — crisp digital art next to warm, flat scans — won't print
uniformly if you just apply the same multipliers to everything, because each
card starts from a different place. So `grade` works in two steps:

1. **normalize (per card, dynamic)** — white-balances the shared card frame to
   one target colour and evens out black/white points, so every card lands on
   the same baseline regardless of how it was made. The target defaults to the
   library's *own median frame colour*, so the collection converges on its own
   consensus; pin it if you prefer.
2. **look (uniform)** — one identical recipe on top. Because the baseline is now
   shared, your intended saturation lands the same way on every card.

```toml
[grade]
normalize = true          # step 1
match_border_target = []  # [] = library median; or pin e.g. [252, 214, 46]
saturation = 1.10         # step 2 — the intended look
contrast   = 1.06
brightness = 1.03         # printers + matte paper dull the image
```

Calibrate the look with a test strip: print one sheet, compare to screen, nudge
the numbers, reprint. Run `proxdex grade --no-normalize` to apply only the
recipe (skip step 1).

## Printing media (washed-out foil)

Some media shift colour — transparent plastic foil especially, where the ink is
semi-transparent so prints come out **lighter and less saturated** than the
screen. `border` bakes a **media profile** into the print stage to cancel that,
so stage 4 is print-ready for a medium while your `edited` master stays neutral
(switch media → just re-run `border`, no regrade):

```toml
[print]
profile = "foil"    # "none" | "paper" | "foil"
```

`foil` boosts saturation and ink density (`saturation 1.38, contrast 1.16,
brightness 0.95, gamma 0.88`). These are a solid automatic starting point;
**calibrate once** with a test print and override any value:

```toml
[print]
profile    = "foil"
saturation = 1.45   # push harder if prints still look washed out
gamma      = 0.85
```

Override per run with `proxdex border --write-print --profile foil`.
